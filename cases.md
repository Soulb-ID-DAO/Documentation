# üêô Use Cases

## On-chain identity validation

Blockchain addresses are, by default, anonymous. The development of the industry is impossible without the personal validation of wallet owners. This is not only a matter of regulating the cryptocurrency market but also the possibility of expanding the functionality of existing systems. Blockchain validation is the next big step in the evolution of Web3. With Soulb ID, dapps can make sure that their users meet the required criteria.

## Access to regulated environments

Most financial transactions are heavily regulated in order to avoid a lot of fraud and chaos. Regulations apply both to currencies and cryptocurrencies, and to the issuance and secondary circulation of securities. All operations control operations are imposed on the centralized authorities. Thanks to Soulb ID, it becomes possible to access regulated assets through decentralized applications. For example, access to the security token market will be greatly simplified by using a global ID on the blockchain.
